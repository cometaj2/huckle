You can execute:

  - pig (alias pig='pip install -e .')
    Executed in this folder, it installs the application as if it had been isntalled through pip
    and changes to the code are immediately reflected.

  - tag (alias tag='python setup.py tag') - maintainer only
    Tags the latest commit in the git repo to whatever __version__ is at.

  - pub (alias pub='python setup.py publish') - maintainer only
    This publishes the application to PyPI, the python package manager, and tags the latest commit
    in the git repo to whatever __version__ is at.

  - output to full width terminal: nroff -man -rLL=$(tput cols)n ./huckle/data/huckle.1
