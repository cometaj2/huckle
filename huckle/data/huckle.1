.SH NAME
huckle \- A generic hypertext command line interface (HCLI) client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B huckle
[
.I option
|
.I <command>
.I <parameter>
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B huckle
is a generic CLI that can be used with any API that abides by
the standard version 1.0 hypertext command line interface (HCLI) semantics.

A terminal restart is required after the creation of the very first CLI alias. CLI aliases created thereafter are immediately usable.

.SH COMMANDS
.IP "env"
This outputs the HCLI entry scripts path to export to enable direct HCLI execution by name (i.e. <cliname>. Equivalent to huckle cli run <cliname>).

"eval $(huckle env)" can be setup in ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile to ensure the path is always loaded on shell start.
.IP "cli install <url>"
This attempts to install/auto configure a CLI if provided with the root URL of an HCLI API. If successful, the CLI
can be invoked by name, and its configuration is located under ~/.huckle/etc/<cliname>/config.

Note that an existing configuration file is left alone if the command is run multiple times
for the same CLI.
.IP "cli rm <cliname>"
Removes an installed CLI.
.IP "cli run <cliname>"
Used to invoke a CLI by name, the details of which are otherwise left to API implementers. This is equivalent to invoking
<cliname> directly after CLI installation and after exporting the huckle env path (see "huckle env").
.IP "cli ls"
Lists all the installed CLIs.
.IP "cli config <cliname>"
Lists the configuration options of an installed CLI.
.IP "<cliname> ..."
The <cliname> alias created for brevity, via huckle cli install.
.IP "<cliname> ... help"
The "help" command can be used anywhere in a command line invocation to generate help pages from an HCLI document. This
is useful to explore what a CLI can do.
.IP help
This help file.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP --version
.B huckle
version and the version of it's dependencies.
.SH EXAMPLE
huckle cli install https://hcli.io/hcli/cli/jsonf?command=jsonf

huckle cli run jsonf (equivalent to simply invoking "jsonf" after a successful cli installation and a terminal restart)

huckle cli ls

huckle cli config jsonf

huckle cli rm jsonf

huckle --version
