.SH NAME
huckle \- A generic hypertext command line interface (HCLI) client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B huckle
[
.I option
|
.I <command>
.I <parameter>
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B huckle
is a generic CLI that can be used with any API that abides by
the standard version 1.0 hypertext command line interface (HCLI) semantics.

CLI aliases are directly invoked by name provided the HCLI entry scripts are locatable in your shell PATH.
See 'huckle env' for details to make your environment configuration more permanent.

.SH COMMANDS
.IP "env"
This outputs the HCLI entry scripts path to export to enable direct HCLI execution by name (i.e. <cliname>. Equivalent to huckle cli run <cliname>).

"eval $(huckle env)" can be setup in ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile to ensure the path is always loaded on shell start.
.IP "cli install <url>"
This attempts to install/auto configure a CLI if provided with the root URL of an HCLI API. If successful, the CLI
can be invoked by name.

Its entry script is located under ~/.huckle/bin/<cliname>.
Its configuration is located under ~/.huckle/etc/<cliname>/config.

Note that an existing configuration file is left alone if the command is run multiple times
for the same CLI.
.IP "cli rm <cliname>"
Removes an installed CLI.
.IP "cli flush <cliname>"
Flushes pinned urls (url cache of final/non-HCLI/API surface urls). The cache is used to increase speed to API surface use and to reduce quantity of network calls.
.IP "cli run <cliname>"
Used to invoke a CLI by name, the details of which are otherwise left to API implementers. This is equivalent to invoking
<cliname> directly after CLI installation and after exporting the huckle env path (see "huckle env").

Note that in certain exceptional cases where a parameter might be passed on the command line, if the parameter value matches exactly an available command,
huckle will not be able to distinguish between an intent to pass a command or a parameter and will require additional information; notably escapement via backslash double quote or single quote.

Huckle accept lazy parameters (without quotes), and this works most of the time, however if ambiguity arises, additional information must be provided.

For example, assuming an "hc" HCLI, an hc "connect" command and otherwise valid "-j" option; the following will fail:

echo '$$' | hc -j "connect"

echo '$$' | hc -j 'connect'

The following however would succeed:

echo '$$'| hc -j \\'connect\\'

echo '$$'| hc -j \\"connect\\"

This would also succeed if multiple words must be passed as a parameter:

echo '$$'| hc -j 'connect me'

echo '$$'| hc -j "connect me"

.IP "cli ls"
Lists all the installed CLIs.
.IP "cli config <cliname>"
Lists the configuration options of an installed CLI.
.IP "<cliname> ..."
The <cliname> alias created for brevity, via huckle cli install.
.IP "<cliname> ... help"
The "help" command can be used anywhere in a command line invocation to generate help pages from an HCLI document. This
is useful to explore what a CLI can do.
.IP help
This help file.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP --version
.B huckle
version and the version of it's dependencies.
.SH EXAMPLE
huckle cli install https://hcli.io/hcli/cli/jsonf?command=jsonf

huckle cli run jsonf (equivalent to simply invoking "jsonf" in the shell after a successful cli installation and setup via 'eval $(huckle env)')

huckle cli ls

huckle cli config jsonf

huckle cli rm jsonf

huckle --version
